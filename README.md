# ðŸŽ¬ Watchlist App v1.0

A simple Python console application that helps users keep track of movies they want to watch in the future. This project was created as part of a programming task, focusing on object-oriented programming, data serialization, and user interaction.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Add a new movie to your watchlist  
- âœ… View all previously added movies  
- âœ… Save movie details permanently using serialization  
- âœ… Simple, menu-driven interface  
- âœ… Runs in the console (terminal)

## ðŸŽ¥ Movie Details

Each movie includes the following information:

- **Title** â€“ The name of the movie  
- **Release Year** â€“ The year the movie was released  
- **Genre(s)** â€“ One or more genres, separated by commas  
- **IMDB URL** â€“ A link to the movieâ€™s page on IMDb

## ðŸ’¾ Data Persistence

All movies are saved permanently using Python's `pickle` module. Even after closing the application, your watchlist is preserved and can be viewed the next time you run the program.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Serialization (`pickle` module)
- Console-based input/output

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. When the app starts, users are presented with three options:
   - Add a new movie
   - View all movies
   - Exit the program
2. Movie data is entered manually and saved immediately.
3. Users can view all saved movies at any time.
4. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the `.zip` file.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory.
4. Run the program with:

```bash
python main.py
